This is a Secure Data Encryption System built with Streamlit, allowing users to securely store and retrieve data using a passkey. The application uses Fernet encryption from the cryptography library to ensure data is encrypted securely. The system features a login mechanism, a store data page for encryption, and a retrieve data page for decryption. Multiple failed attempts are tracked and will require reauthorization.
